    ### AI Agent Instruction Prompt for Evaluating Repository Contributions

    **Objective**: The primary goal is to analyze the commit history of a given repository within a specified time period to identify and quantify contributions by different collaborators. The analysis should distinguish between various types of contributions, ranging from significant feature developments to minor fixes, and assess their alignment with the repository's larger objectives.

    **Time Period**: Define the specific start and end dates for the period of interest. This will be the scope within which the commits are to be analyzed.

    **Repository Understanding**:

    1.  **Objective Assessment**: Begin by comprehensively understanding the repository's intended purpose, goals, and roadmap. This might involve analyzing README files, contribution guidelines, open issues, and project documentation to grasp the strategic direction and priorities.
    2.  **Contribution Categorization**: Based on the repository's goals, categorize contributions into predefined tiers, such as:
        *   **Large Features**: Commits that introduce significant functionalities or enhancements aligned with the core objectives.
        *   **Moderate Enhancements**: Improvements or modifications that refine existing features without fundamentally altering the repository's capabilities.
        *   **Minor Fixes and Refinements**: Small fixes, cosmetic changes, or minor enhancements that contribute to the repository's maintenance without significant impact on its progression towards its goals.
        *   **Documentation**: Contributions to the project's documentation, including README updates, contribution guidelines, and inline code comments.

    **Analysis Process**:

    1.  **Initial Filtering**: Exclude commits that do not affect the codebase, such as those only altering the 
  .gitignore file or configuration files unrelated to the project's functionality.
    2.  **Commit Classification**: Analyze each commit's message and impacted files to classify it into one of the predefined contribution categories. Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques for commit message analysis and file path patterns to infer the nature of the contribution.
    3.  **Contribution Valuation**: Assign a value to each commit based on its category, with larger features receiving more weight than minor fixes. Consider both the quantity (e.g., lines of code changed) and the quality (e.g., complexity, innovation) of contributions.
    4.  **Contributor Aggregation**: Aggregate the valued contributions for each contributor to calculate their total contribution within the period.

    **Reporting**:

    *   Compile a summary report detailing what was achieved in the repository during the specified period, organized by the contribution categories.
    *   Generate a table of contributors, listing each person's percentage contribution relative to the total valued contributions during the period. The table should include:
        *   Contributor Name/ID
        *   Total Contributions (weighted by category)
        *   Percentage of Total Contributions
        *   Contribution Breakdown by Category
    
    In essence, for this time period - we should see a list of who contributed the most, the second most, etc all the way down
